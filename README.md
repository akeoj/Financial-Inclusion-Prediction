# Financial Inclusion Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
Financial inclusion is a complex socio-economic challenge.  
This project applies machine learning classification techniques to explore patterns associated with financial inclusion using structured demographic and economic data.

The project emphasizes **responsible modeling**, interpretability, and awareness of limitations.

---

## Problem Statement
Many individuals remain underserved by formal financial systems.  
The goal is to build predictive models that identify patterns correlated with financial inclusion indicators.

This project is exploratory and does not make policy or eligibility decisions.

---

## Dataset
- Domain: Socio-economic and demographic data
- Target variable: Financial inclusion indicator
- Features include:
  - Income-related variables
  - Demographic attributes
  - Access to financial services
- Dataset may exhibit imbalance and socio-economic bias.

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Data cleaning and normalization
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Handling class imbalance

2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Distribution of inclusion indicators
   - Feature relationships
   - Socio-economic pattern analysis

3. **Modeling**
   - Classification models
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Comparison of model performance

4. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Precision and Recall
   - F1-score
   - Emphasis on interpretability over raw accuracy

---

## Results
- Models identified key factors correlated with financial inclusion
- Trade-offs between precision and recall were analyzed
- Feature importance highlighted economic and access-related drivers

---

## Ethical Considerations
- Predictions reflect patterns in historical data, not individual potential
- Models may inherit bias present in the data
- Results should be used for research and insight, not automated decisions

---

## Limitations & Future Work
- Data limitations and reporting bias
- Generalization across regions may be limited
- Future improvements:
  - Fairness-aware modeling
  - Model explainability enhancements

---

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
